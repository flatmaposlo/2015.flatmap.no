        <h3>CODE OF CONDUCT</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following 
        code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all 
        participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.    
      </p>
      <h4>Need help?</h4>
      <p>
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please 
        contact a member of conference staff. Conference staff will be wearing "flatMap(Oslo)" t-shirts, and 
        "Crew"-badges. You can also get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:flatmap@arktekk.no">flatmap@arktekk.no</a>
      </p>
      <h4>The quick version</h4>
      <p>
        Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of 
        gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not 
        tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for 
        any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference 
        participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the 
        discretion of the conference organisers.
      </p>
      <h4>The less quick version</h4>
      <p>
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical 
        appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, 
        following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate 
        physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised 
        images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised 
        clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem 
        appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please 
       contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing 
       branded t-shirts. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, 
        provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the 
        conference. We value your attendance. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social 
        events.
      </p>

        flatMap(Oslo) - A functional programming conference, with focus on Scala and the Java Virtual Machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the 13th and 14th of May 2013, a group of enthusiasts organised the second flatMap(Oslo) conference. 
        It was 2 amazing days. 130 attendees gathered for technical talks, workshops, discussions and craft beer. 
        Feedback was great, and in 2014 we gather again for the 3rd annual flatMap(Oslo). We will make it a little bit 
        bigger, and aim for 200 attendess. This was always our goal, and what we believe is the perfect size for the 
        conference. Big enough to matter, but still intimate. Also, we can't scale past the capacity of our brewery!
      </p>
      <p>
        flatMap(Oslo) is organised by a group of developers from Arktekk â€“ a small independent consultancy company 
        based in Oslo, Norway. Our financial goal is to break even. Every penny we make will go into making the best 
        possible conference. Together with our awesome sponsors we work hard to give you a conference tailored for 
        enthusiasts of Scala and functional programming on the Java Virtual Machine.
